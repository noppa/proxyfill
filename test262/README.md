# Proxy tests from Test262

The tests in this folder pick Proxy-related tests from the
[Test262](https://github.com/tc39/test262) project, which has large amount of
tests for the implementation conformance of EcmaScript (among others),
including the Proxies.

While we have some more general and easy to debug unit tests of our own, too,
leveraging official EcmaScript test suite gives us easy access to large amount
of tried and tested specs.
